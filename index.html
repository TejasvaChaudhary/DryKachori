            "Rainforests are home to more than half of the world's plant and animal species, despite covering only about 6% of the Earth's surface.",
            "The tallest trees in the rainforest can reach heights of over 200 feet (60 meters). These towering giants are often called emergent trees.",
            "Rainforests are structured in layers: the emergent layer, the canopy, the understory, and the forest floor. Each layer hosts different species of plants and animals.",
            "Rainforests play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.",
            "Many modern medicines are derived from rainforest plants. It is estimated that around 25% of modern medicines come from rainforest ingredients.",
            "Rainforests are home to many indigenous tribes who rely on the forest for their livelihood, culture, and traditions.",
            "Rainforests receive a significant amount of rainfall, typically between 1750 to 2000 millimeters (69 to 79 inches) annually, which is essential for their lush vegetation.",
            "Rainforests are threatened by deforestation, logging, agriculture, and climate change, leading to loss of biodiversity and habitat.",
            "Some rainforests, like the Amazon, are so vast that they create their own weather systems, influencing rainfall patterns in surrounding areas.",
            "Many plants in the rainforest, such as orchids and bromeliads, are epiphytes, meaning they grow on other plants but do not harm them, using them merely for support."
